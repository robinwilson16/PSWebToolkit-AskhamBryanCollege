    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Privacy Notice</h4>

    <p>The College endeavours to be as transparent about the processing of individual data as it can be.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Notice sets out the purpose for collecting the information, your rights in relation to your information we have collected, how we protect your information and who we share your information with.</p>

    <p>For example, the personal information you supply to us will be used by the DfE, to issue you a Unique Learner Number (ULN), and a Personal Learning Record if not already set up. Further information about use and access to your personal data, details of organisations with whom we regularly share data, information about how long we retain your data, and how to change your consent to being contacted, please visit: <a href="https://guidance.submit-learner-data.service.gov.uk/25-26/ilr/ilrprivacynotice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://guidance.submit-learner-data.service.gov.uk/25-26/ilr/ilrprivacynotice</a></p>

    <h5>How We Use Your Personal Data</h5>

    <p>The data you provide including in some cases, special category (or "sensitive") data, will be stored and processed i.e. collected and used, by the College to support your enrolment and provision of education. It will be used for administrative and financial purposes relating to the provision of your education and provision of accommodation (so we can perform our contract with you); for audit and for Ofsted inspection and to provide local education authorities (“LEAs”), schools and academies with information such as destinations data (where we have a statutory obligation to process and share your data); to track student loans, support care standards, safeguarding and health and safety (because of our legal obligations as a public body); for marketing and event management and to monitor compliance with policies and standards (to support the College’s legitimate interests) including the College’s collections policy for failure to pay fees (where we reserve the right to pass your personal details onto debt collectors, if necessary).</p>

    <hr />

    <h5>Sharing Your Data</h5>

    <p>We will share your data with some third parties, including the DfE (Department for Education), LEAs, OfS (Office for Students), Ofsted, Student Loans Company, Higher Education Statistics Agency ("HESA") and awarding bodies where this is necessary for the provision of your education or other core purposes and or where there is a statutory obligation to provide this information.</p>

    <p>For instance, every student must have an Individualised Learner Record (ILR) and the College must collect data about learners and learning undertaken and share those details with the DfE as a condition of its funding. Your information may be shared by the DfE with third parties for education, training, employment and well-being related purposes, including for research.</p>

    <p>The College will not release any of your disclosed personal data to a third party where this contravenes the data protection legislation. <strong>However, we may make a disclosure without consent when: a learner under the age of 18 or a vulnerable adult is believed to be a serious risk of harm; there is evidence of serious public harm or risk of harm to others; there is evidence of serious health risk to the individual; instructed to do so by court of statutory agency in the prevention, detection or prosecution of crime.</strong> If you are under 18 years of age, the College also reserves the right to discuss e.g. your attendance, behaviour, financial matters including bursaries and any safeguarding issues with your named contacts.</p>

    <p>Where your consent is required for us to share your information with third parties such as the provision of catering and transport, offsite activities, etc there will be a clear purpose for the sharing and a data sharing agreement will be put in place to define expectations for the use, control and security of that data. Where your consent is required for us to share your information with third parties, you can withdraw your consent at any time; but this could prevent those services being provided to you.</p>

    <p><strong>We do not share information about our students with anyone without consent unless the law and our policies allow us to do so.</strong></p>

    <p>The College will contact you by email, post or phone/mobile whilst you are studying here regarding your course or progression. It will also contact your next of kin in an emergency by phone.</p>

    <p>You may be contacted after you have completed your programme of learning to establish whether you have entered employment or gone onto further training or education.</p>

    <hr />

    <h5>How Long We Keep Your Data For</h5>

    <p>We hold personal data in accordance with the College data retention policy (see <a href="https://www.askham-bryan.ac.uk/publication-scheme-data-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.askham-bryan.ac.uk/publication-scheme-data-protection/</a> for further details). How long we keep information for will vary according to the type of information.</p>

    <p>Any data will either be deleted or anonymised when no longer needed. Unless otherwise stated, all data will remain at all times within the UK and European Economic Area ("EEA").</p>

    <p>If any data is to be shared outside the EEA, the College will enter into appropriate data processing agreements which will specify the safeguards that have to be in place to comply with UK data protection law, and if applicable, EU data protection law in cases where personal data will transfer to countries of the EU. If you are normally resident outside the EEA such as in the United States, China, Isle of Man or Channel Islands, you consent to your data being transferred outside of the EEA in the event that we have to contact your parents, guardian or carer, or for any other purposes related to your agreement with us, including medical emergency.</p>
    
    <hr />
    
    <h5>College Data Protection Officer</h5>

    <p>If you have any concerns about the way the College collects or uses your personal data, you should raise your concerns in the first instance with the College’s Data Protection Officer, <a href="mailto:judith.clapham@askham-bryan.ac.uk?Subect=Privacy%20Statement">judith.clapham@askham-bryan.ac.uk</a>.
